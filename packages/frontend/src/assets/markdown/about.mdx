# ChainAgreement

A web3 based platform to create agreement between two people and store it on 
blockchain to make it immutable and globally accessible for Open Governance.

## How it works -

For creating agreements you need to have two actors i.e. Initiator and a 
Acceptor both are represented in terms of their addresses. 

Initiator is generally considere the entity who is creating this agreement to 
have a common ground with Acceptor which in almost every case is a receiving 
party.

You also need a title for the agreement and the content of actual agreement 
that is being created.

For creating the agreement a markdown editor is provided and any number of 
clauses can be added to help in making the agreement as verbose as possible.

On launching the website - make sure that you have an ethereum enabled browser.

Upon Launching the application will automatically detect whether you have 
ethereum enabled and if not it will ask you to do so.

Upon doing that you have two options currently -

1. Creating a new agreement.
2. Viewing details for an already created Agreement.

On clicking on create button you will have the interface to enter all the 
details and once clicked on create agreement it will show you a preview of 
agreement that is to be written to IPFS. 

After you are satisfied you can click on write to blockchain which will store 
details on IPFS and then write the same transaction to a blockchain which can 
be verified anytime from anywhere and which guarantees the happening and 
creation of that agreement.

After creation of that agreement it will show you the Agreement ID with which 
you can read this transaction from anywhere. 

For viewing an Agreement you will require the Agreement Id. Once you enter the 
Id and click on view it will show all the details of the Agreement written on 
chain and will give you the link of actual agreement stored on IPFS.
